(From `Written in History` by `Simon Sebag Montefiore`)
>"Letters are the literary antidote to the ephemerality of life. Goethe who reflected much on the magic of letters, thought them to be the most significant memorial a person can leave. And those instincts are right: long after the protagonists are dead, the letters live on" 

Letter from Frida Kahlo to Deigo Rivera:
>"Diego. Nothing compares to your hands, nothing like the green-gold of your eyes. My body is filled with you for days and days. You are the mirror of the night, the violent flash of lightning, the dampness of the earth. The hollow of your armpits is my shelter. My fingers touch your blood. All my joy is to feel life spring from your flower-fountain that mine keeps to fill all the paths of my nerves which are yours."
