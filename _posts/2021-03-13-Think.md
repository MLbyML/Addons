Simon Blackburn's introduction to philosophy reads very nicely and is easy to grasp for a lay reader such as me. 

In the early few pages, he asks the pertinent question of how can one learn philosophy but states that there is a better question to ask:

>"How is philosophy learned? A better question is: how can thinking skills be acquired? The thinking in question involves attending to basic structures of thought. This can be done well or badly, intelligently or ineptly. But doing it well is not primarily a matter of acquiring a body of knowledge. It is more like playing the piano well. It is a `knowing how' as much as `knowing that'. The most famous philosophical character of the classical world, Socrates, did not pride himself on how much he knew. On the contrary, he prided himself on being the only one who knew how little he knew ..."
