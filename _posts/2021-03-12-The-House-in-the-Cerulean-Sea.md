TJ Klune has a nice way of setting up the scene and describing characters as they are introduced. The author uses colors, shapes and feel to describe a person. For example (*thin line*, *lipstick looked like blood*, *black pantsuit*, *skin stretched too tightly*): 

>"Ms. Jenkins reached his desk, her mouth a thin line. As was her wont. She appeared to have applied her makeup rather liberally in the dark without the benefit of a mirror. The heavy rouge on her cheeks was magenta, and her lipstick looked like blood. She wore a black pantsuit, the buttons of which were closed all the way up to just under her chin. She was as thin as a dream, made up of sharp bones covered in skin stretched too tightly."

I find the use of the metaphor *thin as a dream* intriguing. A creative way to describe dreams!
