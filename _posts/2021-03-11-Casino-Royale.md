Ian Fleming's classic work `Casino Royale` reads as a journey in the mind of Bond.  (The movie adaptations are, in comparison, quite detached and rarely explore Bond, the person).

In some paragraphs, Fleming gives a nice description of how Bond is feeling: 

>"Instead he explored his present physical sensations. He felt the dry, uncomforatble gravel under his evening shoes, the bad, harsh taste in his mouth and the slight sweat under his arms. He could feel his eyes filling their sockets. The front of his face, his nose and antrum, were congested. He breathed the sweet night air deeply and focused his senses and his wits."
