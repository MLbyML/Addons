*The Ninth Rain* by Jen Williams starts off with a prologue, highlighting an event occuring 200 years ago. Typically when starting off with an epic saga, the reader often expects hearing about the hero of the tale, while the morally compromised characters are introduced later as the story deepens. This idea is cleverly flipped in the first few pages of the book.

I liked how the back story is provided through letters by Lady Vintage in the start of each chapter. This eliminates the need for a narrator.

"For the joy of knowing, of course!" She patted the girl's arm. "It helps to understand things, don't you think? It makes them less alarming."
Noon looked unconvinced. "Things are less *alarming* when you put a lot of space between you and them. Hiding is easier."

The author's use of similes and color to evoke images in the mind of the reader are quite breathtaking:
