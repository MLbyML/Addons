*The Ninth Rain* by Jen Williams starts off with a prologue, highlighting an event occuring 200 years ago. Typically when starting off with an epic saga, the reader often expects hearing about the hero of the tale, while the morally compromised characters are introduced later as the story deepens. This idea is cleverly flipped in the first few pages of the book.
